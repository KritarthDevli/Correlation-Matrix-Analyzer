# Correlation-Matrix-Analyzer
Correlation Matrix Analyzer is a Python-based project that computes Pearson correlation coefficients for every pair of features in a dataset. It demonstrates both NumPyâ€™s built-in approach and a manual implementation using matrix algebra, providing an educational exploration of correlation computation and data relationships.
