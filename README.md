# ðŸ§  Correlation Matrix Analyzer

**Correlation Matrix Analyzer** is a Python-based project that computes the Pearson correlation coefficients for every pair of features in a dataset.  
It demonstrates three approaches â€” using NumPyâ€™s built-in method, a manual implementation with mathematical formulas, and a matrix algebra approach â€” to understand relationships between data variables.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project helps visualize and understand how strongly each feature in a dataset relates to the others.  
It uses the Pearson correlation coefficient to calculate the strength and direction of linear relationships between numeric variables.

Youâ€™ll see how:
- NumPy simplifies correlation computation.
- Manual implementation gives mathematical insight.
- Matrix algebra can compute correlations efficiently without loops.
